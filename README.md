Bura3 Scripts
=============
##Change your name's color to red
  This script changes your name's color.
  If you want to change it to another color, you can change my script("change_your_name's_color_to_red.js ").

###Example.
  If you want to change it to Blue, you have to change my script in line 18.
  name[i].style.color = "#FF0000";
  â†’name[i].style.color = "#0000FF";
 
  So your name's color is controlled with RGB.
